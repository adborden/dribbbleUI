# adborden's Dribbble Show #

This is an exercise to show some javascript work. The idea was to create a dynamic image library by pulling data from an external site [Dribbble] (http://www.dribbble.com/ "Dribbble"). See it [in action](http://adborden.github.io/dribbbleUI/)!

## Details ##

Load the first nine items from each list (popular, debuts, everyone). Render the shots dynamically when the list's tab is clicked. Reloading the page should not be necessary. <strike>Add to the list each time the user clicks &quot;Load More&quot;</strike> or as the user scrolls.
